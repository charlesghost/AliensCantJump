## Approach

### Game Ideas
During the brainstorming session for the game, i had a interest in making an arcade game (most of the games i came up with were old school games like "Moby Dick", "Snake" etc..) In the end, i decided to pick the best elements from each game to get that old school "arcade" feeling.

The game is loosly based on the popular Doodle Jump game from Lima Sky, but with it's own twist. Rather than jumping until you fall down the screen, gravity is involved in the game. You push the player up all the way to the top. 

## Sprints

### Sprint 1
The aim of the first sprint is to create an mvp with basic functionalties of the game.


### Issues in sprint 1
#### Collision
Figuring out Collision was probably the hardest thing to figure out in the game. Without it, the game wouldn't have been possible.


### Sprint 2

The aim of the second sprint is to build upon the functionalities from Sprint 1's MVP.

### Issues in Sprint 2

#### Features prorities + time
Due to the fact that the collision feature took most of my time, i have limited time to work on the other features. Nevertheless i managed to complete the first  level for this project. 

## Future improvements
- 2 to 4 player feature
- Power ups
- Projectiles
